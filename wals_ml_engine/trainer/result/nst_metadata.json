Dubbed Vision 2020, it envisages Malaysia as a developed nation by 2020. ", "body": "<p /><p>SOME 28 years ago, Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad set a vision for the nation. Dubbed Vision 2020, it envisages Malaysia as a developed nation by 2020.</p><p /><p>The previous prime minister, Datuk Seri Najib Razak, clothed it further. We shall be a rich nation when we attain a per capita income of US$15,000 (RM62,000). When this target was announced in 2010, the per capita income was slightly above US$9,000. Today it is around US$11,500. That is a 23 per cent deficit from the US$15,000.</p><p /><p>The good doctor does invoke the many pillars of his original enunciation of Vision 2020, namely, equality of opportunity, racial integration, religious freedom, and inclusive growth. However, the new government has not announced its adoption of the US$15,000 target in the same manner as its commitment to the 2.8 per cent budget deficit.</p><p /><p>The target of US$15,000 is indeed an ambitious one. It is in line with what a vision should be. In their 1994 book, <em>Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies,</em> Jim Collins and Jerry Porras argue that a vision should be concrete and vivid with a clear finish line.</p><p> It must be so big and audacious that it spurs forward momentum towards the shared future. Although requiring extraordinary effort from stakeholders, the vision may only have a 70 per cent chance of success.</p><p /><p>Notwithstanding, that is the way to formulate an envisaged future. As Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, a German writer and statesman, once exhorted: \u201cDream no small dreams for they have no power to move the hearts of men.\u201d</p><p /><p>Way back in 1990, Dr Mahathir had visualised well the nation\u2019s future. We now need to push ahead, even beyond 2020, to realise our ideal of a rich and inclusive nation.</p><p /><p>Douglas North, a Harvard economist and Nobel Laureate, wrote in his seminal 1990 work <em>Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance</em> that good institutions are central to propelling economic performance. Subsequently, Aaron Acemoglu and James Daron expanded North\u2019s work in their 2012 tome ,<em>Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty</em>.</p><p>Therein they argue that the key to prosperity is inclusive and corruption-free institutions that empower citizens in their pursuit of a meaningful life.</p><p /><p>It is enlightening to know that the government is committed to revitalising our institutions. Good governance, rule of law, and a firm belief in personal freedom and responsibility will buttress this reinvigoration.</p><p>It is also building an honest and capable government to spur economic growth. Such a government should put our nation on the fast track to becoming a rich nation as, to become rich, we need to grow on a sustained basis.</p><p /><p>After four decades of sustained growth, China became an upper middle-income country that has almost obliterated extreme poverty. Similarly, South Korea and Taiwan grew over two decades in a sustained manner to lift themselves out of the middle-income trap.</p><p /><p>To hit a rich-country status, the National Transformation Programme estimated a target growth of at least six per cent annually. However, our rosy growth trajectory became unhinged after the 2008 global financial crisis. Since then we have not been able to register the targeted growth rate.</p><p /><p>Most of the advanced nations became rich through massive government spending in physical infrastructure.</p><p>These expenditures not only inflated the economy, they also offered a sound ecosystem for businesses to enhance their competitiveness.</p><p>The government could pump more money into the economy. Alas, that is not possible with a massive RM1-trillion debt overhang.</p><p /><p>But we can take advantage of Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 comprises, among others, artificial intelligence, robotics and Internet-of-things. Just as the industrial revolution catapulted the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States into the rich-country league, Industry 4.0 can do the same for us.</p><p> By mechanising production, the industrial revolution boosted productivity significantly. It made UK a super-power. So much so, it became \u201cthe Empire on which the sun never sets.\u201d</p><p /><p>We have profited from the benefits of the industrial revolution and Industry 2.0 \u2014 an era characterised by electrification and mass production. Technologies such as those embodied in Industry 4.0 will offer us an array of business models, such as that of Grab and Airbnb.</p><p>They will allow us to launch new products or services, raise productivity and competitiveness. All of these will surely enhance national prosperity.</p><p /><p>Skilled labour will command superior wages. These should contribute to higher per capita incomes. In its 2017 Report on Industry 4.0, the UN Industrial Development Organisation, or UNIDO, contends that advanced developing countries can vastly boost their prosperity by embracing Industry 4.0.</p><p /><p>But per capita income is not all there is to wellbeing. Whether we become rich in material wealth or not is not so important as we becoming rich in our values. We have a great asset in our ethnic diversity. The melange conflates into the shared values of the nation \u2014 tolerance, respect, compassion, obedience to authority and rule of law.</p><p></p><p /><p /><p><b> <i> Datuk Dr John Antony Xavier, a former public servant, is a principal fellow at the Graduate School of Business, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

This year, there is no live coverage. The assembly would still get coverage, depending on the news value generated.</p><p /><p>This year\u2019s assembly, which started on Friday night, is a subdued affair compared with previous ones. Given the defeat the party suffered in the May 9 general election, it is only to be expected that the assembly would be low-key.</p><p /><p>Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan, the former Negri Sembilan menteri besar, who found himself to be party deputy president, officiated at the joint opening of the Youth, Wanita and Puteri wings.</p><p /><p>It was a speech coming from a party leader who made no bones about admitting the pain and agony of losing a national election.</p><p>Mohamad won uncontested in his Rantau seat but he lost the state, as did many other menteris besar.</p><p /><p>Even though the speech was made specifically to Umno leaders from the three movements, I believe its content should also be taken seriously by all Umno members.</p><p /><p>Umno may no longer be the party that had formed the backbone of the Federal Government for decades, but it remains a formidable opponent for Pakatan Harapan. It has experience, a big headquarters and ready administration, branches throughout the country and a claimed membership of more than three million.</p><p /><p>But last May 9, all of Umno\u2019s might fell against the people\u2019s power garnered by Pakatan Harapan and its leader, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad. The rest is history.</p><p /><p>Mohamad gave his reason why Umno failed. \u201cBecause we were careless (<em>cuai</em>) in looking after and carrying out the trust placed upon us,\u201d he said. Short of saying that Umno had betrayed the trust of Malay voters and those who put their faith in the party all these years.</p><p /><p>He didn\u2019t mince his words when he said that many people in Umno used the party as a source of living. Can you imagine what that means?</p><p /><p>In all the years listening to Umno speeches, this is probably the first time I hear a senior party leader saying this.</p><p>There have been whispers in and around party headquarters about the very thing that Mohamad said, but no one has uttered this publicly, more so at the party assembly.</p><p /><p>Mohamad seemed to have risen to the occasion and filled the<br /> post of deputy president very well.</p><p>His speech, the first as Umno number two, was absent of the fiery rhetoric of previous leaders, which was most welcomed.</p><p>He is not known to have taken to any rostrum with fist in the air, screaming advice or cajoling the audience to do their part to serve the party. Rather, he spoke in a sober and measured tone.</p><p /><p>This has always been the Mohamad style, often falling back on his Negri Sembilan intonation.</p><p /><p>If I\u2019m asked which part of his speech was the most important, or which part would be the take- away, I would go for his reminder to everyone in the party to regain their moral compass.</p><p /><p>In order for Umno to move forward with a clear sense of purpose, the party must accept the defeat no matter how painful it is. Obviously Umno cannot rule for 1,000 years, he said, adding that it would take a considerable period of time before it can regain power.</p><p /><p>He told key leaders from the three wings to work hard and forget about wanting to wrest power immediately. The party was now at its most difficult crossroads and many members seemed to have lost their raison d'\u00eatre for the party.</p><p /><p>Such was the impact of the May 9 defeat, many Umno members appeared to have lost direction and self-confidence. Mohamad kept repeating his call for the party to regain its moral compass and ideology, and urged members not to be easily persuaded to become <em>pak turut</em>, or a conformist.</p><p>He must have drawn from his experience as a top international corporate leader whose outfit had lost a major contract and was now in the red.</p><p /><p>\u201cLet us not take the easy route. Let us also not take the short cut. We need big ideas. I chose to stay in the party and work towards prolonging Umno\u2019s life, knowing that the path ahead is filled with tough challenges and problems.</p><p>\u201cUmno\u2019s glory days are over. Accept that, please. The years ahead are full of obstacles, and we have to look for new narration. We need new articulation of fresh ideas. We need to study the big data and use them effectively.</p><p /><p>\u201cWe need good, thinking leaders. We don\u2019t need leaders whose ability is limited to going to the streets and shouting slogans and insulting others in the most demeaning manner,\u201d Mohamad said.</p><p /><p>He didn\u2019t name names but it is not difficult to guess. I don\u2019t know. Maybe he meant that some of the antics by petty leaders make the party a laughing stock.</p><p>Mohamad went on to tell members that they must accept criticisms and shed their sensitive nature. Umno\u2019s future and relevance would very much depend on how well they adapt to life as the opposition.</p><p /><p> <strong>ahmadt51@gmail.com</strong></p><p>The writer is the chairman of Yayasan Salam Malaysia.</p><p>\u00a9 New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>"}, {"nid": 417884, "title": "Puchong drowning: Water pumping method to be used to locate 17-year-old boy", "created": 1538649620, "changed": 1538649620, "url": "https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2018/10/417884/puchong-drowning-water-pumping-method-be-used-locate-17-year-old-boy", "field_article_author": {"tid": 104653, "name": "Fazrik Kamarudin and Nurul Hidayah Bahaudin", "email": null}, "field_article_topic": {"tid": 1, "name": "Nation"}, "field_tags": [{"tid": 2664, "name": "firemen"}, {"tid": 104658, "name": "Weir"}, {"tid": 1145, "name": "drowned"}, {"tid": 15663, "name": "fire and rescue department"}, {"tid": 104570, "name": "Taman Putra Perdana"}, {"tid": 104640, "name": "puchong6"}, {"tid": 104659, "name": "SAR team"}, {"tid": 104660, "name": "water pumping method"}, {"tid": 10536, "name": "teenage boy"}, {"tid": 104661, "name": "D\u2019Island Residence"}], "field_article_images": [{"url": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/copsds_1538649615.jpg", "caption": "Policemen inspect the location where the teenager is believed to have drowned in Taman Putra Perdana, Puchong. - Bernama."}], "field_article_videos": null, "field_image_first_sb_featured": null, "field_image_second_sb_featured": null, "field_image_listing_featured": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/canc10_NSTfield_image_listing_featured.var_1538649618.jpg", "field_image_listing_th": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/canc10_NSTfield_image_listing_th.var_1538649619.jpg", "field_image_three_wide_col": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/canc10_NSTfield_image_three_wide_col.var_1538649620.jpg", "field_image_two_wide_col": null, "field_image_mobile_th": null, "field_article_lead": "PUCHONG: The search and rescue (SAR) team will apply water pumping method to locate the 17-year-old teenage boy who was reported to have drowned at a weir in Taman Putra Perdana, near D\u2019Island Residence.", "body": "<p>PUCHONG: The search and rescue (SAR) team will apply water pumping method to locate the 17-year-old teenage boy who was reported to have drowned at a weir in Taman Putra Perdana, near D\u2019Island Residence.</p><p> Sepang district police chief Assistant Commissioner Abdul Aziz Ali said the approach was taken to reduce water capacity in the mining pond to facilitate the SAR operation.</p><p> \u201cWe will use a water pump that is able to extract 20 cubic metre water per second, it is expected to take several hours for the water to be drained.</p><p> \u201cOnce the water has reduced we will carry out the SAR to locate the victim,\u201d he said when met at the scene here today.</p><p> Abdul Aziz said the method was implemented after police conducted an assessment with other agencies, including Fire and Rescue Department, Civil Defence Department, and Irrigation and Drainage Department.</p><p> \u201cWe could not open the flood gate at the mining pond as it will cause water to overflow to the surrounding areas.</p><p> \u201cAt the same time, we are still deploying our K9 unit to locate the victim.

He is new in the list of witnesses,\u201d he said.</p><p /><p> <strong>\u2018PAC won\u2019t be prejudiced in 1MDB investigations\u2019</strong></p><p /><p> <strong> Question: </strong><strong /><strong> </strong><strong /><strong> Your vision and mission as the new Public Accounts Committee chairman?</strong></p><p /><p> <strong>Answer:</strong> During our first meeting, I made it clear that all committee members are here as members of parliament, not party representatives. We will then be more detailed and clear as there are no thoughts of revenge or wanting to protect anyone. Our mind is clear in that we are here to carry out proceedings and to investigate the country\u2019s finances. Just like previous chairmen, I want to see PAC become a transparent body under Parliament. That is why I am proposing that we make our proceedings public. However, certain laws need to be looked into and amended to suit current times. I believe the people want to know what PAC is doing, not only on 1Malaysia Development Bhd, although it\u2019s clear that 1MDB is a topic of public interest.</p><p /><p> <strong>Q: It seems that you have a lot on your plate. How many times has the committee met? </strong></p><p> <strong>A:</strong> PAC has met 11 times since the new members were appointed on Aug 7. The sessions include meetings, briefings and proceedings. We have been very active in carrying out our duties.</p><p> <strong>Q: There have been a lot of inconsistencies throughout the years on </strong><strong /><strong>1MDB and its subsidiaries, as well as companies such as Good Star Ltd. </strong><strong /><strong>What can we expect from PAC\u2019s handling of the 1MDB case?</strong></p><p> <strong>A:</strong> We will relook at the case as a whole \u2014 on what is lacking, what needs to be adjusted, witnesses that needs to called or recalled. There is no timeline when it comes to PAC investigations, so we will take our time to carry out probes into 1MDB in detail. Right now, there is an issue as to whether our investigations will be considered sub judice. We have checked with the Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers (A-GC) and it will guide us. There are A-GC representatives in our committee and they will inform us on what can or cannot be touched on during proceedings. The 1MDB audit report by the National Audit Department is also no longer classified under the Official Secrets Act. Hence, once we are done with our probe, the report will first be presented to Parliament. It will decide whether to publish it.</p><p /><p> <strong>Q: A little brief on PAC\u2019s meeting with the National Audit Department on Aug 30 and Sept 4?</strong></p><p> <strong>A:</strong> Majority of PAC members are new, including me. Kota Baru MP Datuk Takiyuddin Hassan and Jasin MP Datuk Seri Ahmad Hamzah are the only ones from the (old committee). The briefing was part of an introduction for PAC members on what the department has done on 1MDB.</p><p /><p> <strong>Q: What is the difference between what you were previously informed on 1MDB compared with </strong><strong /><strong>the latest briefing by the Audit Department?</strong></p><p> <strong>A:</strong> It was definitely more detailed. As a PAC member, I take it as it is. It is part of the bigger picture because in our minds, we want to investigate and want to know what happened. We asked a lot of questions to the department about the processes, management, operations and external factors, including things that we have not heard before. I have also read the book <em>Billion Dollar Whale</em>. It is a good read and it is related to what is being investigated by PAC. Meanwhile, the audit report is about the internal accounts and technical side of things.</p><p /><p> <strong>Q: Do you think reading the book and </strong><strong /><strong>other various sources on 1MDB would affect your </strong><strong /><strong>assessment?</strong></p><p> <strong>A:</strong> PAC can read everything, but I assure you that it will not affect, influence or lead to any prejudices in our investigations. PAC is just like the courts \u2014 we focus on what is in front of us, the evidence and statements. The books and stories may give us a broader explanation.</p><p /><p> <strong>Q: You have been </strong><strong /><strong>Beluran MP for four terms under </strong><strong /><strong>Barisan Nasional. How has it been for you since becoming an opposition MP?</strong></p><p> <strong>A:</strong> My constituency is having a hard time understanding that we are no longer under the ruling government, so they are still demanding for things that we used to provide, such as transportation and paying their electric and water bills. Some are slowly accepting it, but it is hard as they have been pampered for 18 years. Although the new government has provided about RM100,000 in funds for rural areas under opposition MPs, it is not enough. Beluran is half the size of Selangor, with approximately 23,000 people. Logistics is a major issue for us. Basic facilities, education and infrastructure are much needed. However, I would like to thank the government for providing funds for opposition parliamentarians.</p><p /><p /><p>\u00a9 New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>"}, {"nid": 417428, "title": "(Updated) Rosmah arrested, to be charged tomorrow", "created": 1538556773, "changed": 1538575206, "url": "https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2018/10/417428/updated-rosmah-arrested-be-charged-tomorrow", "field_article_author": {"tid": 2142, "name": "Rahmat Khairulrijal", "email": null}, "field_article_topic": {"tid": 1, "name": "Nation"}, "field_tags": [{"tid": 1103, "name": "putrajaya"}, {"tid": 976, "name": "macc"}, {"tid": 1835, "name": "Rosmah Mansor"}, {"tid": 2333, "name": "arrested"}], "field_article_images": [{"url": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/rosmhadir-o3_1538558816.jpg", "caption": "Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor was taken into custody today while she was giving her statement at the MACC headquarters. - NSTP/Mohamad Shahril Badri Saali"}], "field_article_videos": null, "field_image_first_sb_featured": null, "field_image_second_sb_featured": null, "field_image_listing_featured": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/RosmahArrestNK_NSTfield_image_listing_featured.var_1538558818.jpg", "field_image_listing_th": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/RosmahArrestNK_NSTfield_image_listing_th.var_1538558819.jpg", "field_image_three_wide_col": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/RosmahArrestNK_NSTfield_image_three_wide_col.var_1538558820.jpg", "field_image_two_wide_col": null, "field_image_mobile_th": null, "field_article_lead": "PUTRAJAYA: Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor was taken into custody today while she was giving her statement at the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) headquarters, here, today.", "body": "<p>PUTRAJAYA: Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor was taken into custody today while she was giving her statement at the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) headquarters, here, today.</p><p /><p>The New Straits Times learnt that Rosmah, 66, is looking at between 15 and 17 charges for alleged offences under the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act (AMLATFPUAA) 2001, involving monies amounting to RM7 million.</p><p /><p>Earlier, she presented herself for questioning at 10.42am accompanied by her lawyer Datuk K.

This means parents should kneel and squat down when they talk to their kids. This gesture, psychologists say, helps children feel secure and shows that their parents are ready to engage with them.</p><p>The importance of eye contact benefits parents too. Going down to their child\u2019s level allows parents to see the world from their little one\u2019s perspective.</p><p>I have often been baffled why my 8-month-old son cries whenever he is on his walker and I walk away to the kitchen. But one day, when I sat next to him, I realised that at 70cm tall, his vision is obstructed by the dining table and he could not see my face. Hence, the cries.</p><p /><p /><p> [[gn4id:10106592]]</p><p /><p /><p /><p /><p> <strong>PROMOTING EYE CONTACT</strong></p><p>Norwegian children lifestyle brand Stokke is big on eye contact. Each product in its stable is designed for that purpose. The Tripp Trapp chair, for instance, is an infant, baby, toddler, child and adult chair all rolled into one. It\u2019s a baby chair meant to bring the little human to the adult dining table. And unless it\u2019s fastened with a baby set and tray, it doesn\u2019t look like a baby chair.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty much how we design our products. Everything is made to increase eye contact between the child and the adult because that\u2019s how a baby or a child learns the cues to communicate,\u201d says its Asia-Pacific regional marketing manager Tiffany Jieh.</p><p>\u201cThe unifying character of all Stokke products is that they bring children closer to the people around them. We design in the best interest of the child. Eye contact is good for kids\u2019 development because that\u2019s their visual cue and that\u2019s how they learn how to be happy and to laugh,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cEye contact promotes the feeling of security when everything is new. And parents help babies understand the environment. When you smile at your baby, your baby will smile back at you,\u201d she says.</p><p /><p /><p> [[gn4id:10106593]]</p><p /><p /><p /><p> <strong>PREMIUM STROLLER</strong></p><p>Jieh was in the city to launch the Stokke Xplory 6 (available at HappiKiddo stores), the brand\u2019s upgrade of the Xplory range. It\u2019s the brand\u2019s most expensive stroller and the latest version costs between RM5,753 and RM6,319 depending on your colour choice. \u201cBut it gives the ultimate height. It gives three adjustable height levels so the child can see his or her parent.\u201d</p><p>There have been studies, she says, that conclude that babies in prams, due to the little elevation from the floor, are exposed to more pollutants than adults who are on foot. \u201cAnd that\u2019s another reason why ours are high up. It gives more protection to the baby and the baby is closer to the one pushing him or her.\u201d</p><p>Once the baby is old enough, he\u2019d want the stroller to face out. And while others are low, this one is high, giving the baby a higher vantage point, rather than only seeing adults\u2019 legs all around him.</p><p>The stroller comes with extended canopy for ventilation and textiles with SPF50+ protection. The wheels offer ultimate manoeuvrability.</p><p /><p /><p> [[gn4id:10110758]]</p><p /><p></p><p /><p /><p> <strong>NICHE FOLLOWING</strong></p><p>While pricey, Jieh says the premium stroller segment has a following of its own. Stokke\u2019s customers are millennial mothers, those who are stylish, informed and do extensive research before making a purchase.</p><p>\u201cA premium stroller, besides its design and safety, is also a status symbol for mothers who want a stroller as an extension of their personalities. Our customers are digitally well-informed and educated. When they go to our store to buy, it\u2019s just to confirm the fit. They have done all the browsing online before coming to the shop.</p><p>\u201cI think when it comes to a premium stroller, the quality is unmistakable. There are a lot of little details we put in to show that we design for the child\u2019s safety and comfort while keeping a product stylish.\u201d</p><p /><p /><p> [[gn4id:10106590]]</p><p /><p /><p /><p>Jieh says Malaysia, unlike Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore, is a booming market for premium strollers. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely growing faster than Singapore, and we get a lot of pregnant first-time mothers interested in our products. And that\u2019s the pattern, when it\u2019s your first child, you tend to splurge more.\u201d slizta@nst.com.my</p><p>\u00a9 New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>"}, {"nid": 418462, "title": "Cops nab 8 suspected terrorists", "created": 1538798934, "changed": 1538798934, "url": "https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2018/10/418462/cops-nab-8-suspected-terrorists", "field_article_author": {"tid": 1072, "name": "Teoh Pei Ying", "email": null}, "field_article_topic": {"tid": 1, "name": "Nation"}, "field_tags": [{"tid": 1118, "name": "TERRORIST"}, {"tid": 2349, "name": "islamic state"}, {"tid": 4595, "name": "IGP"}, {"tid": 47169, "name": "Mohamad Fuzi harun"}, {"tid": 104844, "name": "salafi jihadism"}], "field_article_images": [{"url": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/fuziz_1538798928.jpg", "caption": "Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi Harun, in a statement today, said the arrests were made after obtaining intelligence on the efforts of a terrorist group upholding Salafi jihadism to set up religious centres in the region.

After being schooled by a few failed ventures, I figured that I had learnt some lessons to become better.</p><p /><p>The next thing I thought about is that it had to do with me focusing solely on my consulting practice, EQTD Consulting Malaysia.</p><p /><p>When I stopped experimenting with multiple business ideas, and concentrated on training and management consulting, I picked up new and more engaging clients, who incidentally paid better.</p><p /><p>But after intense reflection, I realised that these were not the main reasons for my growth.</p><p /><p>The single most important thing that happened to me after my thirty-fifth birthday was that I met my wife, Susanna.</p><p /><p>Upon thorough reflection, I can say without any hesitation, she is the biggest reason for my progress.</p><p /><p>And before you think this is just a soppy piece that\u2019s dedicated to my life-partner, allow me to share some research with you about my secret weapon at work.</p><p /><p>Numerous studies have indicated that when it comes to earning extra money at work, promotions, and other measures of career success, it is the influence of your life-partner that is the biggest on your performance.</p><p /><p>One in particular that was published in the journal, Psychological Science in 2014, caught my attention.</p><p /><p>Researchers from Washington University in St. Louis examined about 5000 married people, ranging in age from 19 to 89, over a period of five years, to extrapolate these findings.</p><p /><p>In the sampling, 75% were couples where both partners were working. And, the research focused on five areas of relationship personality. They were openness; extraversion; agreeableness; neuroticism; and conscientiousness.</p><p /><p>The results were incredible.</p><p /><p>The people who had the highest, measured occupational success had a spouse with a personality that scored high for conscientiousness.</p><p /><p>In my column on the 24th of August 2018, I wrote about conscientiousness being arguably the most vital trait in achieving any sustainable results at work, and in life.</p><p /><p>Conscientiousness or thoroughness is the personality trait of a person who shows an awareness of the impact that their own behaviour has on people around them. And, conscientious people are generally more goal-oriented in their motives, ambitious in their academic efforts, and at work.</p><p /><p>This research by Washington University suggests that if you want to be successful at work, you must also have a life-partner who is conscientious.</p><p></p><p>Why does a conscientious spouse matter?</p><p /><p>The results from the research show that having a conscientious life-partner increases the likelihood of solid support for your day to day operations, and emotional support.</p><p /><p>In real terms, this means you can rely on your partner to share your daily chores, such as paying bills, going to the market, solving household issues, caring for your pets, and importantly, raising your kids.</p><p /><p>Of course, when you have a spouse who assists in the smooth running of your life, your stress levels come down dramatically, and you end up finding better work-life balance.</p><p /><p>The research also shows that if you live with a conscientious spouse, you tend to carry those traits of diligence and reliability into your own workplace.</p><p /><p>It is commonly accepted that a bad experience in one part of your life, spills over to other parts. For example, a crappy day at work might lead to a tense night at home, or a grumpy husband or wife.</p><p /><p>This study went beyond that and argues that good behaviour exerted subtly by your spouse has an important influence on your performance at work. You will feed off each other\u2019s positive energy.</p><p /><p>The foundation for being supportive as a life-partner lies in you respecting their personal decisions.</p><p /><p>I cannot stress this more.</p><p /><p>Recently, I was offered, what many would call, a life changing job offer. It included lots of travel, lots of opportunity to influence others, and most crucially, bucket loads of money.</p><p /><p>But, it would have also required me to relocate to another country, and I knew that this wouldn\u2019t work for my wife, who has a thriving holistic veterinary practice in Kuala Lumpur.</p><p /><p>My decision was made absolutely easier because Susanna asked me to decide based purely on my professional needs, and assured me that she would support any decision I took.</p><p /><p>She did not apply a modicum of pressure on me to reject the offer based on her own personal and professional needs.</p><p /><p>I turned the offer down, quite happily. And, a large part of that was due to my wife giving me the space, and showing me that she truly respected my needs.</p><p /><p>So, remember, you\u2019d better choose a spouse, or have chosen someone who is supportive, kind, and who is conscientious, if you want your career to flourish.</p><p /><p> <strong>Shankar R.

Win or lose, that is not important. But it can be a platform for us to convey our views and criticisms of the government, a platform to be an effective opposition.</p><p>But Umno leaders chose to boycott the event. I disagreed with them. It is not a good decision. So I decided to run.</p><p>Secondly, for the Telok Kemang Umno division, ever since my dad was leading the charge here, we had always wanted Umno to contest the seat, which is now renamed Port Dickson.</p><p>Back then, the Malay majority was more than 50 per cent. In 2004, with the opening of the Rembau parliamentary seat, it led to the decrease of the Malay majority in Port Dickson to 43 per cent.</p><p>Umno has always wanted to contest this seat and we have been discussing the possibility with MIC. When there is an opportunity and MIC is pulling out from the race, we (Umno) should go in. But that is not the case.</p><p> I was left with no choice. People are saying that I am a grassroots man, Umno had done so much for me, or that I had never run away from the party, but I don\u2019t agree with the boycott. This is a good opportunity for us.

He has Permatang Pauh and Pandan. Some even offered Nibong Tebal and Sungai Petani. Why did he choose Port Dickson?</p><p /><p> <strong>Q: Is it a challenge to remind people that you are </strong><strong /><strong> contesting under an independent logo?</strong></p><p> <strong>A:</strong> There are those who did not realise that I am an independent candidate, including some elders in my family. Yesterday, at the Linggi night market, one of my supporters asked me why did I leave Umno. I had to explain the situation to him.</p><p>It is not that difficult to make them aware that I am an independent candidate. Some of the older voters still know how to read. So they will look for my name (or logo) before voting.</p><p>I\u2019m not contesting against Umno. I\u2019m going against Umno\u2019s traditional enemies \u2014 PKR and Pas. Umno has been against PKR for 20 years and 60 years with Pas.</p><p>Of course, if Umno is contesting, that would be a different story. So there is no reason for BN and Umno members not to support me because I\u2019m not going against them.</p><p>If they want to take action against me or my son (for campaigning for me), I don\u2019t care so much about that. What is important is that they understand that although I\u2019m not contesting on behalf of Umno, I am going against Umno\u2019s enemies.</p><p /><p> <strong>Q: The people of Port Dickson will expect something from you if you win.</strong></p><p> <strong>A: </strong>I will render to them my services, just like how I did previously. I may be able to give better services. I have never forgotten to serve Port Dickson as my political base. I will be committed to the people here.</p><p>Development-wise, it will never end. Roads will have to be maintained or improved. For several sectors, such as tourism, the infrastructure is there. We just need to add few things to improve them. There is not much land (for building projects) too. Port Dickson is full of estate land, from Sepang to Linggi.</p><p>Whatever it is, we\u2019ll leave it to the locals (if they want more development). If you want to have another five-star hotel, we have a lot of them here.</p><p /><p> <strong> Q: What are your chief concerns about the by-election?</strong></p><p> <strong> A:</strong> I will be worried if my supporters do not come out to vote. There are many friends, Umno and family members here. Some of them might think that the by-election\u2019s outcome will not change anything, if I win or lose. So I told my machinery to make sure that our supporters come out and vote, especially our hardcore voters.</p><p>Our approach must be up-todate. The kids nowadays like to eat KFC, but we (the older generation) like to eat steamed bananas. If I told my son to eat the latter, he might give me a strange look. I can\u2019t tell him to eat steamed bananas every day.</p><p>The people know my track record. I have served them here, although I am not the parliamentarian. I am a local who mingles with the grassroots. When I meet people at the market, they will say: <em>\u201c</em>Oh, ini kita punya orang kampung.<em>\u201d</em></p><p>They asked me where I have been and I said I was in Jempol, but now I'll be in Port Dickson. They are happy about that.</p><p>I was never a member of parliament for Port Dickson. I had been contesting the Linggi state seat for 25 years. In 2009, I won the Bagan Pinang by-election. And later, I returned as Jempol MP. If I win, this will be my first time being the Port Dickson MP.</p><p /><p /><p /><p /><p>\u00a9 New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>"}, {"nid": 417032, "title": "When the legend will fall", "created": 1538468266, "changed": 1538470925, "url": "https://www.nst.com.my/sports/mma/2018/10/417032/when-legend-will-fall", "field_article_author": {"tid": 2236, "name": "Intan Maizura Ahmad Kamal", "email": null}, "field_article_topic": {"tid": 22836, "name": "MMA"}, "field_tags": [{"tid": 126, "name": "Sports"}, {"tid": 202, "name": "Malaysia"}, {"tid": 99, "name": "japan"}, {"tid": 199, "name": "thailand"}, {"tid": 2248, "name": "New Zealand"}, {"tid": 28157, "name": "ONE Championship"}, {"tid": 12390, "name": "MMA"}, {"tid": 46634, "name": "Ev Ting"}, {"tid": 104322, "name": "Kingdom of heroes"}, {"tid": 104323, "name": "Shinya Aoki"}], "field_article_images": [{"url": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/wohoo_(2)_1538468256.jpg", "caption": "Japanese legend Shinya Aoki (left) and the highly pumped EV Ting. -Pix credit: ONE Championship"}, {"url": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/wohoo_(3)_1538468667.jpg", "caption": "The biggest moment for Ting came in the third round, when he floored Ando with a huge knee, sealing the decision victory on the judges\u2019 scorecards. - Pix credit: ONE Championship"}, {"url": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/wohoo_(1)_1538468262.jpg", "caption": "Ev Ting emerges victorious against Japan's Koji Ando at ONE Pinnacle of Power showcase in June. - Pix credit: ONE Championship"}], "field_article_videos": null, "field_image_first_sb_featured": null, "field_image_second_sb_featured": null, "field_image_listing_featured": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/intanmma_NSTfield_image_listing_featured.var_1538468264.jpg", "field_image_listing_th": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/intanmma_NSTfield_image_listing_th.var_1538468265.jpg", "field_image_three_wide_col": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/intanmma_NSTfield_image_three_wide_col.var_1538468266.jpg", "field_image_two_wide_col": null, "field_image_mobile_th": null, "field_article_lead": "BANGKOK, THAILAND: It\u2019s not going to be easy, but Malaysian-New Zealand martial arts star Ev \u201cE.T\u201d Ting has his mind set on a first-round finish when he finally gets into the fight cage with martial arts legend, Shinya Aoki (41-8) come ONE: KINGDOM OF HEROES on Oct 6, 2018.", "body": "<p /><p>BANGKOK, THAILAND: It\u2019s not going to be easy, but Malaysian-New Zealand martial arts star Ev \u201cE.T\u201d Ting has his mind set on a first-round finish when he finally gets into the fight cage with martial arts legend, Shinya Aoki (41-8) come ONE: KINGDOM OF HEROES on Oct 6, 2018.</p><p /><p>Ting, the 29-year-old (16-4) ONE Championship lightweight martial artist, is convinced that the 35-year-old legend from Shizuoka, Japan will find it tough to handle his variety of striking and will end the night at Bangkok\u2019s Impact Arena with his ninth career defeat.</p><p /><p>Confidence lacing his voice, Ting said: \u201cHe\u2019s got to get past my striking, hug me and take me down.

In one post, without naming her, he suggested that she was a \u2018power-mad prostitute\u2019.</p><p>After the police brought charges of sedition, a judge found him guilty and sentenced him this month to seven years in prison.</p><p>Suu Kyi\u2019s government could have kept the case from reaching court. But for the Nobel Peace laureate and onetime democracy icon, suppressing criticism has become a hallmark of her leadership.</p><p>Much of the world had high hopes for Myanmar two and a half years ago, when Suu Kyi came to power. So much has changed.</p><p>Once a symbol of resistance to military rule, Suu Kyi is known today as an enabler of ethnic cleansing and a foe of press freedom.</p><p>Hopes that she would use her party\u2019s majority in parliament to encourage badly needed economic growth and abolish oppressive laws have faded.</p><p>Now, about halfway through Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy party\u2019s five -year term in office, Myanmar is in danger of again becoming a pariah state, as it was under the rule of the generals who once kept her under house arrest.</p><p>\u201cRarely has the reputation of a leader fallen so far, so fast,\u201d concluded a recent report by the Brussels-based International Crisis Group.</p><p>Since August, Western powers and international organisations have taken significant steps to punish Myanmar for its military\u2019s use of rape, arson and murder to drive more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims out of the country.</p><p>The United States imposed targeted sanctions, a UN mission called for top generals to face genocide charges and judges of the International Criminal Court ruled that they have the authority to investigate the matter.</p><p>Myanmar is also under pressure to free two Reuters journalists, Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, who were sentenced this month to seven years in prison after reporting on killings of Rohingya.</p><p>Suu Kyi, 73, who spent 15 years under house arrest during military rule, emerged from isolation as a hero, across Myanmar and abroad. Her party swept elections in 2015 and took office the following year. It now controls both the parliament and the presidency.</p><p>But she is hamstrung by a military-drafted constitution that divides power between the generals and her quasi-civilian government.</p><p>It also bars her from the presidency, though she found a workaround by choosing Win Myint, a longtime ally, to serve as president and report to her.</p><p>She gave herself the title of state counselor and also named herself foreign minister. In those roles, she has become known for stubbornness and an imperious style.</p><p>The constitution gives autonomy to the army\u2019s commander in chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. He appoints three cabinet ministers, who oversee the country\u2019s security forces, and a quarter of parliament\u2019s members, enough to block any constitutional amendment.</p><p>Some former supporters worry about Suu Kyi\u2019s closeness to the military, known as the Tatmadaw.</p><p>During a recent appearance in Singapore, she said her relations with the military were not bad.</p><p>The three generals in the cabinet, she volunteered, were \u201crather sweet\u201d.</p><p>\u201cSuu Kyi has covered for the military, and thereby condemned the whole country to vilification, all due to her stubborn certainty that she has all the answers, when it\u2019s clear she has few answers or ideas and almost no empathy,\u201d said David Mathieson, an independent political analyst based in Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s largest city.</p><p>Suu Kyi rarely grants interviews to the news media. Her spokesman, Zaw Htay, did not answer repeated calls from The New York Times.</p><p>Her dwindling number of defenders have argued that the military\u2019s outsize power has left her with few options. But with her control of parliament and the presidency, Suu Kyi could enact legislation on a wide array of social issues that lie outside the Tatmadaw\u2019s jurisdiction.</p><p>At a forum in Vietnam this month, Suu Kyi said the reporters had been sentenced for breaking the law, not for journalism. \u201cIf anybody feels there has been a miscarriage of justice, I would like them to point it out,\u201d she said.</p><p>When they were arrested, the journalists were reporting on a massacre of 10 Rohingya Muslims, whose mass grave they discovered.</p><p>The victims were just a few of the countless Rohingya killed in the western state of Rakhine in the Tatmadaw\u2019s campaign of violence, meant to drive them across the border into Bangladesh.</p><p>The Rohingya have long been denied even basic rights in Myanmar, a majority Buddhist country where most people regard them as having migrated illegally from Bangladesh, though many have been in the country for generations. In its report last month calling for Min Aung Hlaing and other commanders to be tried for genocide, a UN mission singled out Suu Kyi for not using her position as the de facto head of government, or her moral authority in Myanmar, to try to stop the atrocities.</p><p>Instead, the report said, officials in her government spread false narratives, denied the military had done anything wrong, oversaw the destruction of evidence and blocked independent investigations, including that of the UN mission itself.</p><p>\u201cThrough their acts and omissions, the civilian authorities have contributed to the commission of atrocity crimes\u201d, concluded the 444-page report, which was presented to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on Sept 18. <b>NYT</b></p><p /><p>\u00a9 New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>"}, {"nid": 417048, "title": "No more clerical work for teachers from next year", "created": 1538470413, "changed": 1538470413, "url": "https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2018/10/417048/no-more-clerical-work-teachers-next-year", "field_article_author": {"tid": 104334, "name": "Audrey Vijaindren and Meor Ridwuan Meor Ahmad", "email": null}, "field_article_topic": {"tid": 1, "name": "Nation"}, "field_tags": [{"tid": 11349, "name": "teachers"}, {"tid": 471, "name": "education ministry"}, {"tid": 91736, "name": "maszlee malik"}, {"tid": 104335, "name": "education revamp"}], "field_article_images": [{"url": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/DR_MASZLEE_MALIKnomoreclericalwork_1538470409.jpg", "caption": "The Education Ministry is aiming to relieve teachers from the burden of clerical duties as early as the beginning of next year.

Murallitharan told Bernama recently.</p><p>Breast cancer is the top cancer afflicting women worldwide. In Malaysia, one in every 30 women is at risk of this disease.</p><p>Early detection practices like mammograms (a screening tool to detect breast cancer in women), clinical breast examinations and breast self-examinations remain some of the most important ways to detect breast cancer early and increase survival rates.</p><p>The size of the detected tumour determines which cancer stage a patient is at and, according to the American Cancer Society, the five-year survival rate declines quickly as breast cancer proceeds to the next stage.</p><p>The five-year survival rate refers to the percentage of people who live at least five years after being diagnosed with cancer.</p><p>At stage zero, the abnormal cancerous cells are non-invasive which means they are still within the original location of the breast where they started.</p><p>Stage one occurs when the cancer cells break through the original site and invade the surrounding tissue.</p><p>At this stage, the tumour is just under or at two centimetres and it is still within the boundaries of the breast.</p><p>There are two subcategories or conditions for this stage: the first condition is there is no lymph node involvement and the second, there is micro-metastases or very small spreading out of one to three lymph nodes.</p><p>Stage two breast cancer has two subcategories as well. In the first subcategory, the tumour is more than two centimetres but smaller than five centimetres with lymph node involvement.</p><p>The second subcategory is where the tumour is larger than two centimetres but without lymph node involvement or larger than five centimetres but not attached to the chest wall and without lymph node involvement.</p><p>\u201cWhen a tumour is discovered between stages one and two, the chances for a successful treatment is at its highest as it is still contained locally,\u201d said Dr Murallitharan, a public health physician.</p><p>Stage three has three subcategories. The first subcategory is where the tumour is less than five centimetres and has spread to five to nine lymph nodes but has not spread to distant sites.</p><p>The second subcategory has two conditions \u2013 first, the tumour has grown into the chest wall or skin but without lymph node involvement and second, the tumour has not grown but up to nine axillary (armpit area) lymph nodes are involved.</p><p>The third subcategory is where the tumour can be at any size, spread to 10 or more lymph nodes in areas such as under the clavicle or collarbone or above the clavicle, and the cancer has enlarged the mammary lymph nodes.</p><p>At this level, the cancer cells are beginning to reach out beyond the breast with some lymph nodes invaded, while the tumour may or may not have attached itself outside the breast.</p><p>Stage four is the advanced stage where the cancer has spread beyond the breast and its adjacent lymph nodes to other organs of the body that may include the brain, lungs or liver.</p><p>\u201cIt is also called metastatic cancer and if cancer reoccurs it is often at this stage,\u201d Dr Murallitharan explained.</p><p>Stressing the importance of regular breast self-checks that can be done while showering and would take less than a minute, he said: \u201cSymptoms to look out for during breast self-checks include swelling of all or part of the breast, skin irritation or dimpling, breast or nipple pain, nipple retraction or nipple turning inward, redness, scaliness or thickening of nipple or breast skin, and/or unusual nipple discharge.\u201d</p><p>Women who are over 40 years old are encouraged to get a yearly mammogram. A recent Swedish Cancer Institute study revealed that women between the age of 40 and 49 who have had yearly mammograms and subsequent breast cancer diagnosis fare better than those who do not.</p><p>Meanwhile, to promote breast self-checks, NCSM will collaborate with Southern Lion Sdn Bhd, which manufactures and markets shower foam under the Shokubutsu brand, to conduct the Breast Self-Check: You Are My Pink Reason campaign.</p><p>The one-month campaign will start in the middle of this month. During the campaign, NCSM professional nurses will tour Malaysia\u2019s central region in a mobile truck themed, \u201cYou Are My Reason\u201c, to provide free clinical breast examinations to women.</p><p>\u201cThe nurses will also teach women the correct methods of conducting a breast self-examination, as well as the signs to look out for in breast cancer.</p><p>\u201cOn top of that, the truck will be providing additional health services, including body mass index measurement and blood glucose and blood pressure readings,\u201d said Southern Lion managing director Tatsuya Horiuchi.</p><p>The campaign will also feature a series of contests and activities to educate the public on the importance of doing breast self-checks to detect cancer early.</p><p>\u2013 Bernama</p><p>\u00a9 New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>"}, {"nid": 417082, "title": "Kelana Jaya line service disruption due to loss of propulsion, says Rapid Rail [NSTTV]", "created": 1538472353, "changed": 1538493227, "url": "https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2018/10/417082/kelana-jaya-line-service-disruption-due-loss-propulsion-says-rapid-rail", "field_article_author": {"tid": 1072, "name": "Teoh Pei Ying", "email": null}, "field_article_topic": {"tid": 1, "name": "Nation"}, "field_tags": [{"tid": 104350, "name": "Rapid Rail Kelana Jaya line"}, {"tid": 16509, "name": "service disruption"}, {"tid": 104351, "name": "Rapid Rail Kelana Jaya line chief operating officer Ismail Abdullah"}], "field_article_images": [{"url": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/rapidd_1538493225.jpg", "caption": "Kelana Jaya Rail Chief Operating Officer, Ismail Abdullah briefed journalists at a press conference on the delay of Kelana Jaya's LRT route.

Actor Paul Rudd of Ant-Man fame came out top as Singapore\u2019s most dangerous celebrity. For the twelfth year in a row, McAfee researched famous individuals to reveal the riskiest celebrity to search for online. The research reveals which celebrities generate the riskiest search results that could potentially expose their fans to malicious websites.</p><p /><p>From model and MTV VJ to Batwoman, Ruby Rose\u2019s acting career took off in 2015 when she was cast as Stella Carlin in the Netflix series, <i>Orange is the New Black</i>. Now Rose can add \u201cfirst Australian to take the top spot on the McAfee Most Dangerous Celebrities study\u201d to her list of accomplishments. Reality TV star, Kristin Cavallari finished behind Rose at No. 2, followed by actress Marion Cotillard (No. 3), the original Wonder Woman Lynda Carter (No. 4), actress Rose Byrne (No. 5), star of <i>Will and Grace</i> Debra Messing (No. 6), reality TV star Kourtney Kardashian (No. 7), actress Amber Heard (No. 8), morning TV show host Kelly Ripa (No. 9), and finally actor Brad William Henke round out the top 10.</p><p /><p>It\u2019s no secret that cybercriminals attempt to use the allure of celebrity to trick unsuspecting consumers into visiting malicious websites that can be used to install malware or steal personal information and passwords. The study, conducted by McAfee, highlights the dangers of clicking on suspicious links when searching for celebrity-focused content.</p><p /><p>\u201cWe live in a fast-paced world that\u2019s heavily influenced by pop culture where it\u2019s possible to pick and choose which entertainment options we prefer to enjoy from a variety of connected devices,\u201d said Gary Davis, chief consumer security evangelist at McAfee.</p><p /><p>\u201cOften consumers put speed and convenience over security by clicking on suspicious links that promise content featuring our favorite celebrities, such as our favorite movies, TV shows or pictures. In our hyper-connected world, it\u2019s important for consumers to think before they click to be sure that they are surfing to safe digital content and protecting themselves from cybersecurity threats that may be used to infect their devices or steal their identity,\u201d said Davis.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>How to search safely</b></p><p><br></p><p>1.Be careful what you click. Users looking for a sneak-peek of the CW series, Batwoman starring Ruby Rose should be cautious and only download directly from a reliable source. The safest thing to do is to wait for the official release instead of visiting a third-party website that could contain malware.</p><p><br></p><p>2.Apply system and application updates as soon as they are available. Very often the operating system and application updates include security fixes. Applying updates is an important step to help ensure devices stay protected.</p><p><br></p><p>3.Browse with security protection. McAfee Total Protection is a comprehensive security solution that can help keep devices protected against malware, phishing attacks, and other threats. It includes McAfee WebAdvisor which can help protect against going to malicious websites.</p><p><br></p><p /><p>4.Use parental control software. Kids are fans of celebrities too, so ensure that limits are set on the child\u2019s device and use software that can help minimise exposure to potentially malicious or inappropriate websites.</p><p /><p /><p /><p /><p>\u00a9 New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>"}, {"nid": 418220, "title": "Former Tabung Haji chairman Azeez Rahim's son detained by MACC", "created": 1538731602, "changed": 1538743066, "url": "https://www.nst.com.my/news/crime-courts/2018/10/418220/former-tabung-haji-chairman-azeez-rahims-son-detained-macc", "field_article_author": {"tid": 64247, "name": "Irwan Shafrizan Ismail", "email": null}, "field_article_topic": {"tid": 22826, "name": "Crime & Courts"}, "field_tags": [{"tid": 9791, "name": "BROTHER"}, {"tid": 976, "name": "macc"}, {"tid": 8952, "name": "remand"}, {"tid": 1813, "name": "baling"}, {"tid": 48976, "name": "azeez"}], "field_article_images": [{"url": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/WhatsApp_Image_2018-10-05_at_09.46.23_1538743068.jpg", "caption": "Baling MP Datuk Seri Abdul Azeez Rahim"}], "field_article_videos": null, "field_image_first_sb_featured": null, "field_image_second_sb_featured": null, "field_image_listing_featured": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/azeezbro_NSTfield_image_listing_featured.var_1538731601.jpg", "field_image_listing_th": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/azeezbro_NSTfield_image_listing_th.var_1538731602.jpg", "field_image_three_wide_col": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/azeezbro_NSTfield_image_three_wide_col.var_1538731602.jpg", "field_image_two_wide_col": null, "field_image_mobile_th": null, "field_article_lead": "PUTRAJAYA: The Malaysian Anti Corruption Commission (MACC) has detained Datuk Seri Abdul Azeez Rahim\u2019s son shortly after the Baling member of parliament was released from remand.", "body": "irwansha@nstp.com.my<p /><p>PUTRAJAYA: The Malaysian Anti Corruption Commission (MACC) has detained Datuk Seri Abdul Azeez Rahim\u2019s son shortly after the Baling member of parliament was released from remand.</p><p> The 24-year old was detained at the MACC headquarters at noon after he was summoned there.</p><p> He is being questioned for investigation under Section 16 (a) of the MACC Act 2009 for soliciting or receiving gratification.</p><p> The MACC is expected to obtain a remand for Azeez's son at the magistrate's court here tomorrow morning.</p><p> It was reported that the MACC seized RM500,000 in cash and RM1.2 million in various currencies from houses belonging to Azeez on May 23.</p><p> The raids were to facilitate investigations into the appointment of contractors involving Tabung Haji projects.</p><p> MACC later remanded Azeez and his brother, Abdul Latif, for four days after their arrests on Sept 25.</p><p> The remand order was later extended to another six days.</p><p> Both of them were released earlier today on bail of RM1 million each in two sureties.</p><p /><p>\u00a9 New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>"}, {"nid": 416687, "title": "Cradle Fund CEO's body to be exhumed", "created": 1538370918, "changed": 1538370918, "url": "https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2018/10/416687/cradle-fund-ceos-body-be-exhumed", "field_article_author": {"tid": 73523, "name": "SARAH ZULKIFLI", "email": null}, "field_article_topic": {"tid": 1, "name": "Nation"}, "field_tags": [{"tid": 257, "name": "murder"}, {"tid": 216, "name": "BODY"}, {"tid": 92147, "name": "Nazrin Hassan"}, {"tid": 104183, "name": "exhume"}, {"tid": 102246, "name": "Cradle Fund CEO"}], "field_article_images": [{"url": "https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/PERMOHONAN_GALI_SEMULA_KUBURgwyhfgdfhsdfgghfdjsdjexhume_1538370912.jpg", "caption": "The Magistrate\u2019s Court has granted an application by the police to exhume the body of Cradle Fund chief executive officer Nazrin Hassan after his death was reclassified as murder.
